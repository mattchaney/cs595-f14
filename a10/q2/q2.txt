Manually classify the first 50 entries, and then classify (using
the fisher classifier) the remaining 50 entries. Report the cprob()
values for the 50 titles as well.  From the title or entry itself,
specify the 1-, 2-, or 3-gram that you used for the string to
classify.  Do not repeat strings; you will have 50 unique strings.
For example, in these titles the string used is marked with *s:

*Rachel Goswell* - "Waves Are Universal" (LP Review) 
The *Naked and Famous* - "Passive Me, Aggressive You" (LP Review)
*Negativland* - "Live at Lewis's, Norfolk VA, November 21, 1992" (concert)
Negativland - "*U2*" (LP Review)

Note how "Negativland" is not repeated as a classification string.

Create a table with the title, the string used for classification,
cprob(), predicted category, and actual category.
