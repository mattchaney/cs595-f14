Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar as long as it has
an Atom or RSS feed).  It should be on a topic or topics of which you
are qualified to provide classification training data.  In other words,
choose something that you enjoy and are knowledgable of.  Find a feed
with at least 100 entries.

Create between four and eight different categories for the entries
in the feed:

examples: 

work, class, family, news, deals

liberal, conservative, moderate, libertarian

sports, local, financial, national, international, entertainment

metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop

Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 
class slides.
