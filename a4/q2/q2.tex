\subsection{Question}
\verbatiminput{q2/q2.txt}

\subsection{Answer}
Using python to parse each of the 100 files from Question 1, all of the links that each URI contained were extracted from the source html, converted to the GraphViz\cite{dot:graphviz} dot format and stored in a file named {\tt links.gv}. To save space in the graph the urlparse\cite{py:urlparse} python module was used to shorten the URIs used as labels. The code used is in Listing \ref{listing:dot}.
