From your list of 1000 links, choose 100 and extract all of the
links from those 100 pages to other pages.  We're looking for user 
navigable links, that is in the form of: 

<A href="foo">bar</a>

We're not looking for embedded images, scripts, <link> elements,
etc.  You'll probably want to use BeautifulSoup for this.

For each URI, create a text file of all of the outbound links from
that page to other URIs (use any syntax that is easy for you).  For
example:

site: 
http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/    
links:
http://www.cs.odu.edu/
http://www.odu.edu/
http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/research/
http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/
http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/
http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2013/09/2013-09-09-ms-thesis-http-mailbox.html
etc.

Upload these 100 files to github (they don't have to be in your report).
