Download and install Gephi:

Load the dot file created in #2 and use Gephi to:

- visualize the graph (you'll have to turn on labels)
- calculate HITS and PageRank
- avg degree
- network diameter
- connected components

Put the resulting graphs in your report.

You might need to choose the 100 sites with an eye toward
creating a graph with at least one component that is nicely
connected.  You can probably do this by selecting some portion
of your links (e.g., 25, 50) from the same site.
