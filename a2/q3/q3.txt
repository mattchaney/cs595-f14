Estimate the age of each of the 1000 URIs using the "Carbon Date" tool:

Note: you'll have better luck downloading and installing the tool 
rather than using the web service (which will run slowly and likely
be unreliable).

For URIs that have > 0 Mementos and an estimated creation date,
create a graph with age (in days) on one axis and number of mementos
on the other.
