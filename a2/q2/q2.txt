Download the TimeMaps for each of the target URIs.  We'll use the mementoweb.org 
Aggregator, so for example:

URI-R = http://www.cs.odu.edu/

URI-T = http://mementoweb.org/timemap/link/http://www.cs.odu.edu/

You could use the cs.odu.edu aggregator:

URI-T = http://mementoproxy.cs.odu.edu/aggr/timemap/link/1/http://www.cs.odu.edu/

But be sure to say which aggregator you use -- they are likely to give
different answers.

Create a histogram of URIs vs. number of Mementos (as computed from
the TimeMaps).  For example, 100 URIs with 0 Mementos, 300 URIs
with 1 Memento, 400 URIs with 2 Mementos, etc.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram

Note that the TimeMaps can span multiple pages.  Look for links like:

<http://mementoweb.org/timemap/link/1000/http://www.cnn.com/>;rel="timemap"; 
type="application/link-format"; from ="Sun, 08 Jul 2001 21:30:54 GMT"

This indicates another page of the TimeMap is available.  There can be 
many pages to a TimeMap.
