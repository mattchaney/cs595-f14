\subsection{Answer}
Using the python script in Listing \ref{listing:gethtml}, 1000 unique URIs were dereferenced and
their contents were stored into a file with the filename as the md5-hashed URI. Another file was created,
called {\tt uri\_map} that was used to map the URIs to their md5-hashed filenames.
