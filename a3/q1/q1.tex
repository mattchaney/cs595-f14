\subsection{Answer}
Using the python script in Listing \ref{listing:gethtml}, 1000 unique URIs were dereferenced and
their raw contents were stored in the {\tt html/raw/} folder as a file with the filename as the
md5-hashed URI. These were then stripped of all html elements and their processed contents were 
stored in the {\tt html/processed/} folder as the same md5-hashed filename.
