Download the 1000 URIs from assignment #2.  "curl", "wget", or
"lynx" are all good candidate programs to use.  We want just the
raw HTML, not the images, stylesheets, etc.

from the command line:

% curl http://www.cnn.com/ > www.cnn.com

% wget -O www.cnn.com http://www.cnn.com/

% lynx -source http://www.cnn.com/ > www.cnn.com

"www.cnn.com" is just an example output file name, keep in mind
that the shell will not like some of the characters that can occur
in URIs (e.g., "?", "&").  You might want to hash the URIs, like:

% echo -n "http://www.cs.odu.edu/show_features.shtml?72" | md5
41d5f125d13b4bb554e6e31b6b591eeb

("md5sum" on some machines; note the "-n" in echo -- this removes
the trailing newline.) 

Now use a tool to remove (most) of the HTML markup.  "lynx" will
do a fair job:

% lynx -dump -force_html www.cnn.com > www.cnn.com.processed

Keep both files for each URI (i.e., raw HTML and processed). 

If you're feeling ambitious, "boilerpipe" typically does a good
job for removing templates:
