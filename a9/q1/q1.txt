Create a blog-term matrix.  Start by grabbing 100 blogs; include:

http://f-measure.blogspot.com/
http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/

and grab 98 more as per the method shown in class.

Use the blog title as the identifier for each blog (and row of the
matrix).  Use the terms from every item/title (RSS) or entry/title
(Atom) for the columns of the matrix.  The values are the frequency
of occurrence.  Essentially you are replicating the format of the
"blogdata.txt" file included with the PCI book code.  Limit the
number of terms to the most "popular" (i.e., frequent) 500 terms,
this is *after* the criteria on p. 32 (slide 7) has been satisfied.

Create a histogram of how many pages each blog has (e.g., 30
blogs with just one page, 27 with two pages, 29 with 3 pages and 
so on).
