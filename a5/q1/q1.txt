Explore the friendship paradox for your Twitter account.  Since
Twitter has directional links (i.e., "followers" and "following"),
we'll be investigating if the people you follow (Twitter calls these
people "friends") follow more people than you.  If you are following <
50 people, use my twitter account "phonedude_mln" instead of your own.

Create a graph of the number of friends (y-axis) and the friends sorted
by number of friends (x-axis).  (The friends don't need to be labeled on
the x-axis as "Bob", "Mary", etc. -- just 1, 2, 3 ...)  In other words,
if you have 100 friends your x-axis will be 1..101 (100 + you), and the
y-axis value will be number of friends that each of those friends has.
The friend with the lowest number of friends will be first and the friend
with the highest number of friends will be last.

Do include yourself in the graph and label yourself accordingly.  Compute
the mean, standard deviation, and median of the number of friends that
your friends have.
