The goal of this project is to use the basic recommendation principles
we have learned for user-collected data. You will modify the code
given to you which performs movie recommendations from the MovieLense
data sets.

The MovieLense data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research
Project at the University of Minnesota during the seven-month period
from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998. It is available
for download from http://www.grouplens.org/node/73

The code for reading from the u.data and u.item files and creating
recommendations is described in the book Programming Collective
Intelligence (check email for more details). You are to modify
recommendations.py to answer the following questions. Each question
your program answers correctly will award you 10 points. You must
have the question answered completely correct; partial credit will
only be awarded if your answer is very close to the correct one.

Your output should clearly indicate the answers from the question
you answered.  Provide any relevant discussion.
