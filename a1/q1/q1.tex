\section{Question 1}

\subsection{Question}
Demonstrate that you know how to use "curl" well enough to 
correctly POST data to a form.  Show that the HTML response that
is returned is "correct".  That is, the server should take the
arguments you POSTed and build a response accordingly.  Save the
HTML response to a file and then view that file in a browser and
take a screen shot.
